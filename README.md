# F1/10 Autonomous Driving

## Description
Austin Atchley and Logan Zartman

The code in this repo is used in conjunction with [another repo](https://github.com/ut-amrl/f1tenth_course) provided for us by Professor Joydeep Biswas for the class CS 378: F1/10 Autonomous Driving. It is used to pilot an autonomous RC car using the ROS environment.
